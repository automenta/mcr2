A comprehensive development plan for the Model Context Reasoner (MCR) is detailed below, outlining the project from its foundational components to its most advanced, long-term capabilities. This plan is organized into distinct phases, each with specific objectives and key results, to ensure a structured and coherent development process.

### **Phase 1: Foundational Core and API**

This initial phase is focused on establishing the fundamental architecture of the MCR library. The primary goal is to create a stable, usable core that other developers can build upon. This includes setting up the main classes, the session management system, and the basic interface for interacting with the reasoning engine.

**Objectives:**

*   Implement the core `MCR` and `Session` classes.
*   Establish the stateful, isolated reasoning sessions.
*   Develop the initial library-first API with `async/await` support.

**Key Results:**

*   A functional `MCR` class that can be instantiated with a configuration.
*   A `createSession` method that generates isolated `Session` objects.
*   A `Session` class with placeholder methods for `assert`, `query`, and `reason`.
*   A basic, in-memory knowledge graph for each session.
*   A comprehensive test suite for the core API and session management.

### **Phase 2: Symbolic Reasoning and Prolog Integration**

With the core API in place, the next step is to integrate the symbolic reasoning engine. This phase will bring the logical core of MCR to life, enabling it to perform deterministic reasoning based on a set of facts and rules.

**Objectives:**

*   Integrate a Prolog engine into the MCR library.
*   Implement the `getKnowledgeGraph` method.
*   Develop the internal mechanisms for asserting facts and querying the Prolog knowledge base.

**Key Results:**

*   A `Session` class that can manage an underlying Prolog instance.
*   The ability to add, remove, and query facts and rules directly in Prolog.
*   A `getKnowledgeGraph` method that accurately returns the current state of the knowledge base as a Prolog string.
*   Internal functions that can execute Prolog queries and return the results.

### **Phase 3: LLM Integration and Natural Language Interface**

This phase focuses on bridging the gap between human language and the symbolic core. The goal is to enable MCR to understand and process natural language inputs by integrating Large Language Models (LLMs).

**Objectives:**

*   Implement a pluggable architecture for LLM providers.
*   Develop the initial "Direct-to-Prolog" translation strategy.
*   Implement the `assert` method to translate natural language into Prolog facts.

**Key Results:**

*   A configuration system that allows users to easily switch between different LLM providers (e.g., OpenAI, Google, Anthropic).
*   A basic translation strategy that prompts an LLM to convert natural language sentences into Prolog syntax.
*   A functional `assert` method that takes a natural language string, uses the LLM to translate it, and adds the resulting Prolog fact to the knowledge graph.
*   An `integrationReport` that details the original text and the symbolic representation that was added.

### **Phase 4: Hybrid Reasoning and Explainability**

This phase will build upon the previous ones to develop MCR's core features of hybrid reasoning and explainability. The goal is to create a system that can not only provide answers but also explain how it arrived at them, and to fall back on the LLM's knowledge when the symbolic reasoner cannot find a solution.

**Objectives:**

*   Implement the natural language `query` method.
*   Develop the explanation generation system.
*   Implement the sub-symbolic fallback mechanism.

**Key Results:**

*   A `query` method that translates a natural language question into a Prolog query and returns the answer in natural language.
*   An `explanation` array in the query result that traces the logical steps taken to reach the conclusion.
*   A `confidence` score in the query result, with a score of 1.0 for symbolically derived answers.
*   The `allowSubSymbolicFallback` option in the `query` method, which, if enabled, will ask the LLM the original question directly if the Prolog query fails and return the LLM's answer with a lower confidence score.

### **Phase 5: Advanced Reasoning and Knowledge Graph Management**

This phase focuses on enhancing the intelligence and robustness of the reasoning process. The goal is to move beyond simple fact assertion and develop a more structured and reliable knowledge base.

**Objectives:**

*   Develop more advanced translation strategies.
*   Implement support for ontologies to constrain the knowledge graph.
*   Enhance the `reason` method for more complex, multi-step tasks.

**Key Results:**

*   New translation strategies that use structured intermediate representations (e.g., JSON) to reduce LLM syntax errors.
*   Self-correction mechanisms within translation strategies to re-prompt the LLM upon failure.
*   The ability to define an ontology that specifies the types of entities and relationships allowed in the knowledge graph.
*   The system will be able to identify and reject assertions that violate the ontology.
*   An improved `reason` method that can perform a sequence of assertions and queries to achieve a higher-level goal.

### **Phase 6: Autonomous Learning and Evolution**

This is a long-term, forward-looking phase aimed at making MCR a system that can learn and improve over time. The focus will be on creating feedback loops that allow the system to refine its own reasoning capabilities.

**Objectives:**

*   Implement a framework for logging and evaluating the performance of translation strategies.
*   Develop a mechanism for automatically refining and generating new strategies.
*   Begin research and development into automated knowledge acquisition from unstructured sources.

**Key Results:**

*   A logging system that records the performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, latency) of different translation strategies.
*   An "optimizer" module that can analyze performance data and suggest modifications to strategy prompts and logic.
*   A prototype system for ingesting and processing unstructured text (e.g., from a document or website) to automatically populate the knowledge graph.
*   A fully realized `reason()` method that functions as a true agentic loop, capable of breaking down complex goals into solvable steps.

### **Phase 7: Multi-Modal Expansion and Ecosystem Growth**

This final phase outlined in the plan focuses on expanding MCR's capabilities beyond text and fostering a community around the library. The architectural decisions made in the earlier phases should facilitate this expansion.

**Objectives:**

*   Design and implement a strategy interface that can accommodate non-textual data.
*   Develop a rich ecosystem of documentation, tutorials, and examples.
*   Foster a community of contributors and users.

**Key Results:**

*   An architecture that allows for the creation of new strategies for processing inputs from images, data streams, and other modalities.
*   Comprehensive online documentation with detailed API references and conceptual guides.
*   A gallery of example projects demonstrating how to use MCR for a variety of use cases.
*   A clear contribution guide and community forum to encourage external involvement in the project's development.
